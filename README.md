  This project enables users to query a Pharmacy Management Database using natural language instead of SQL.  
A local LLaMA 3 (8B) model running through Ollama generates SQL queries, executes them on SQLite, self-corrects on failure, and returns tabular results.


  Traditional pharmacy systems require SQL knowledge. This project solves that by enabling natural language analytics for pharmacists, managers, and medical staff - without cloud dependency or privacy concerns.
